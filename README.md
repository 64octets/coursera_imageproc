## About
My solutions to optional programming assignments in the online course 
_[Image and video processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a stop at the 
hospital](https://www.coursera.org/course/images)_, offered by the 
Duke University at Coursera. Note that all exercises are optional and 
ungraded so the students are permitted (and encouraged) to share their code.

All the code is implemented in Matlab with the Image Processing Toolbox. 
It can also be run in Octave (the package _[Image](http://octave.sourceforge.net/image/)_
is required).

## Test image
Test scripts use the famous image _Lena_ (or _Lenna_) for testing purposes. 
To avoid any possible copyright infringement, the image is not included 
into this repository, however it can be downloaded from [here](http://www.ece.rice.edu/~wakin/images/).

## Run
Each subdirectory contains a script `task.m` that will perform all tasks 
suggested by the selected weekâ€™s assignment.
